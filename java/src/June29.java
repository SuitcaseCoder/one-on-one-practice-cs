//TODO: prompt a user to tell us about themselves (age, name, if they
// have any pets (true/false). Using method overloading, create methods
// that will return the first fact they told us about themselves. ex: I can input: 18 --
// Laura -- false in which case I expect you to return: 18. but if I
// tell you my name first: Laura -- false -- 18. I expect you to return
// "Laura" ... etc.
